## Purpose
Using a sample month from the succesful Citi Bike in NYC we will see if a bike sharing comapany is feasable in Des Moines Iowa.
August of 2018 was chosen to show the usage of bikes by local subscibers and customers as well as tourists visiting the city during the warm summer month.
Let us dive in shalle we!
## Steps and Results
First things first. Lets find how how many trip we are dealing with. While we wont have quite this much traffic in Des Moines, it does give us an idea of how popular this service is in only one month of data.<br>
<br>

Next we will see the length of time bikes were used during specific times. The example below is from midnight to 2. You can choose which ever hour of the day you would like to look at.  <BR>

Taking the the same graph as the one above we next break it down into gender.

In this bar chart we can take a look at the total amount of trips being taken throught the day for every day of the month. One of the most important aspects of this graph is the early AM times. This is an ideal time to for bike placement and maintenance.<BR>

<BR>
Now we will look at the same data broken down into weekdays. A heatmap was the best graph for this visulaization. As you can see Monday through Friday before and after work are key times for this service as well as the weekend afternoons. Also backing up the early AM data from the previous chart.

We can further breakdown the heatmap to show each genders usage.

Lets look at just the days on that gender map and further break it down to seperate the Customer form the Subscriber.<BR>

##Summary
From the results we can see that a bike sharing business in Des Moines, Iowa is definitly worth it. We know our initial target customer/sunscriber will be males within the city and close outlying areas. ONce a strong foundation is aquired we can directly target females. We know when the maintenance will be done on our bikes to keep them clean and running. 
  * Would like to see more data on the tourist industry to try to capture as much of that base as possible. Two more graphs to consider:<BR>

  While Subscribers are going to be our bread and butter, you can still see the amount of customer trips. The map show us two distinct areas where the majority of trips taken are by customers not subscribers; Governors Island and Central Park.
